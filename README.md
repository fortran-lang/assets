# Assets

This repository contains all assets, artwork and graphics used by `fortran-lang` projects.

## The "F" logo

The "F" logo was designed by Jacobs William (@Beliavsky) with the violet color
being selected by Milan Curcic (@milancurcic). The design is based after the
cover of the original IBM Fortran programmer's reference manual from 1956.
The logo is the letter "F" in a Clarendon BT font on a violet background with rounded edges.
